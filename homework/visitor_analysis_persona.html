                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>This website is build for baseball fans all over the world. It focuses on being easy to use by adding rotating articles, easily used video links and menu options to navigate easily on the top. The target demographics are baseball fans of all kinds, most likely between 15 years old and 60 years old. There isn't any need for education to navigate and is available to all that love baseball. This site meets the needs of fans because often they are searching for videos or statistics in MLB. It gives all of these right up front or links to correct places quickly. This site is enjoyable because it has many articles on whatever team you'd like to research along with videos and statistics that catch your eye. It is very easy to use on a mobile device and stays non cluttered and easy to use.</p>

                <h2>Contrast</h2>
                <p>Contrasting mlb.com to another site I used called imleagues.com is easy. mlb.com worked hard to create an easy to look at and simple to use site. imleagues.com shown below, is poorly put together and frustrating to use for many reasons. There are many situations where you need to shrink or expand the web page as the site is not fitted to the screen. Other times you have to input information like school name or username ahd the website tries to find your information but instead will often block the screen, making it impossible to use. It targets college students playing rec league sports but misses the mark on meeting the needs of the users. It tries to act like it is being used on a desktop computer and thus misses an opportunity to assist those using mobile devices."I love my Rangers and can't wait for next year!"</p>
