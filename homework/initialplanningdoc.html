                <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>

                <p>The purpose of this site is to create a working weather website for three different locations. This developed site will bring together different information for the locations of Franklin, ID as well as Greenville, SC and Springfield, IL.

                    <h2>Persona</h2>
                    <p>Stephen is a business man and a father. He lives in a relatively small town and has to travel long distances to get to work or to get home after. Many days his travel is done by bicycle and he very rarely uses a car. The thing he always worries most about in his daily travel is the weather. He likes to make sure if he will be biking that day that he will not have a run in with bad weather or anything he did not expect. Depending on the situation he may have different devices from his personal cell phone or tablet when he is at home or his desktop computer at work. He checks the weather regulary to ensure comfortable and safe travel.</p>

                <h3>Peer Review: Joel Jossie</h3>
                    <p>Joel was the peer that did my review. He said "The purpose statement and persona are very well done. The audience section seems oddly specific about the age specifications, but thats not a big deal. The wireframe sketches are pretty good as well, although the spacing seems pretty vague." I appreciate these comments and will be adjusting my wireframes to have a better format to flow better on the web page.</p>
