    <h1>HTML TITLE AND ALT ATTRIBUTES</h1>
        <h2>Alt Attributes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One way to think of alternative text is to think about how you would read the page containing the image to someone over the phone, without mentioning that there is an image present. Whatever you say instead of the image is typically a good start for writing the alternative text.
        </li>
        <li>More Simply the alt attribute gives information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it. This attribute helps understand the content of the image with words.</li>
        <li>"EX: <img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face">"</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Title Attributes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The title attribute specifies extra information about an element displayed as a tooltip. The value is text.
        </li>
        <li>Relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification.</li>
        <li>Here, a title attribute is added to the p element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:</li>
        <li><p title="I'm a tooltip">
            This is a paragraph. (scroll over to see the title)
            </p></li>
    </ul>
